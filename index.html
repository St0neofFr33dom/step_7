        <p id="tribute-info">The kiwi bird is an endangered bird found only in the country of New Zealand. It is nocturnal and flightless, eating fruits and insects it finds in the ground. Until the 1500's it had no predators until mammals such as dogs and ferrets arrived along with colonists, which heavily reduced the population. It has great cultural significance to New Zealand, being adopted as symbol to represent the country. Huge amounts of conservation work is being carried out so that the Kiwi can survive out in the wild.</p>
